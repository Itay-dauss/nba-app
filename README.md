The NBA app is a platform that helps us manage our favorite basketball players with the option to search for players by first name or last name.
A list of favorite players will give us the opportunity to follow them during the NBA, who knows maybe the list will change in the end.
In the future, more information will be added about the players such as age, team, number of points per season, number of three-pointers and records.
